Hello my name is Chafe Solomon

This is something i created to help the IT department as a whole open tickets directly with just a ticket number. 

Requirments: 
This script uses Python 3.7 but i believe it works on 3 in general. 
There are many ways to get it to load with a hotkey but i suggest using a macro program where you can set up a hotkey to open the script.


There are 3 additional commands in this script.

Main: Brings you to whatever queue you left off in.
New: Creates a new ticket
Knowledge: Takes you to the knowledge base
